This is repo that I will be using to detail and commit code as I progress through a udemy ML/R course, this repo will be the R repo. I intend to commit and add code as I go through the course, altering the steps as needed, context and thought process will be displayed largely through commit messages, so if you are looking for how I think, that's the place to check out. This readme will get a revamp soonish.
